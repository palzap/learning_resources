# IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things)

## General concepts
*   Use of smart sensors, actuators and other devices to collect data;
*   Analysis of the collected data aid in enhancing reliability and eficiency of manfacturing and industrial processes;
*   Eficient analysis enable companies to solve problems sooner, improve quality ratios, enhance traceability and implement more sustanaible practices;
*   There are many technologies involved in the IIoT process, these are some examples:

### Cyber-physical systems (CPS)
Main enabler to connect physical machines that were previously disconnected. CPS integrates the dynamics of the physical process with those of software and communication, providing abstractions and modeling, design, and analysis techniques.

### Cybersecurity
Protects IIoT systems from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats.

### Cloud Computing
Provides scalable and flexible computing resources for storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of IIoT data.

### Edge Computing
Enables real-time data processing and analysis at the edge of the network, reducing latency and improving response times.

### Mobile Technologies
Facilitate remote monitoring, control, and management of IIoT devices and systems using mobile devices.

### Big Data Analytics
Extracts valuable insights from large datasets generated by IIoT devices, enabling predictive maintenance, optimization, and decision-making.
