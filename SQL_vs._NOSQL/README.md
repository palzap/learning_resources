# SQL vs. NoSQL Databases

## SQL (Structured Query Language) Database

*   Relational databases;
*   Data is organized in a table like maner;
*   Easily matches data by using common characteristics (name, age, etc...);
*   Single server type of database, scalability is dependent on hardware upgrades (RAM, CPU);
*   Easier to code SQL queries, meaning that the needed expertise to interact with this type of database is lower;
*   ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) compliance;

## NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Database
*   Non-relational databases;
*   Can store any type of data without the constraint of the table like scheme;
*   Easier to scale and more versatile to manage;
*   Multiple node share system, this means scalability can be done horizontally by adding more servers without the need to upgrade older ones;
*   Since data is unstructured, querying data on this type of database requires a higher expertise;
*   BASE (Basic Availability, Soft state, and Eventual consistency) model;
